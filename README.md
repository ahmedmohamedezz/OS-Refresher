# 📘 OSTEP Study Notes

![img](./ostep.webp)

Notes and code from my study of **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)** by Remzi & Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau.

This repository contains summaries, explanations, experiments, and implementations I wrote while learning core operating systems concepts including virtualization, concurrency, and persistence.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a deep understanding of how operating systems work.
- Reinforce concepts with code (C, Java, Python).
- Document experiments from the book (e.g., CPU scheduling, threads, memory API tests).
- Practice systems programming and debugging.
- Create a personal reference I can return to later.
